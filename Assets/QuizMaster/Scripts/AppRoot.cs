/// It is considered a best practice to create ONE GameObject at the top of your 
/// app and attach everything to it. (Note that you can create multiple Roots which 
/// will result in multiple Contexts.  This can be desirable, but it's an advanced use case.
/// Recommend you stick to a single Context until you're confident you know what you're doing.
/// 
/// The GameObject to which this MonoBehaviour is attached to called the 'ContextView'
/// and is injectable anywhere in the application. This is especially
/// useful in commands, where you can access the ContextView to attach further GameObjects 
/// or MonoBehaviours.
